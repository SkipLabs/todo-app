# SKDB Demo: To-Do App

An example React + SKDB project.

Deliberately simple, this app is designed to demonstrate SKDB's power for
building reactive applications, making use of shared state with real-time
synchronization, collaboration and privacy features.

Follow along with the [quick-start guide](todo: link here) or jump straight to the
`tags-feature`, `likes-feature`, or `access-control-feature` branches to see how
easy SKDB makes it to build increasingly-complex features.
